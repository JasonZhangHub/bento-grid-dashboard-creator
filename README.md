# Bento-Grid Dashboard Creator
 
This tool automatically generates clean, modern, and engaging bento-grid style dashboard layouts.
 
**Key Features:**
 
* **Automated HTML Generation:** Let the agent build the layout for you.
* **Bento Grid Style:** Leverage the popular, modular, and aesthetically pleasing bento grid design.
 
## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Installation
 
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JasonZhangHub/bento-grid-dashboard-creator.git
    cd bento-grid-dashboard-creator
    ```
2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended):**
    ```bash
    # For Unix/macOS
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
 
    # For Windows (Command Prompt)
    # python -m venv .venv
    # .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set `PYTHONPATH` (If Necessary for Your Setup):**
    ```bash
    # Add project root to PYTHONPATH
    export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)"
    ```
5.  **Install Chromium Browser (for HTML to JPEG conversion):**
    The feature to convert HTML to JPEG relies on Playwright, which uses a browser engine like Chromium.
    * **Standard Installation:**
        ```bash
        playwright install chromium
        ```
    * **Troubleshooting SSL/TLS Errors (e.g., `SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`):**
        If you are on a network with SSL inspection, the command above might fail due to certificate issues.
        1.  **Recommended Solution:** Configure Node.js to use CA certificate. This typically involves setting the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable to the path of your CA certificate file or using `npm config set cafile <path_to_cert.pem>`. 
        2.  **Workaround (use with caution as it's less secure):** If the recommended solution isn't immediately feasible, you can temporarily bypass SSL/TLS certificate verification for the download.
            ```bash
            # For Linux/macOS & PowerShell on Windows:
            NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 playwright install chromium
 
            # For Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe):
            # You may need to set the variable first in the same session:
            # set NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
            # playwright install chromium
            ```
            *Only use the workaround command if the standard installation fails due to SSL errors and you understand the security implications.*
 
### Usage
 
The tool provides three main functionalities accessible via Python scripts:
 
1.  **Generate HTML Page from PDF (`generate_bentogrid_html.py`)**
    This script processes an input PDF file and creates a bento-grid styled HTML page, ideal for modern dashboard-like announcements.
 
    * **How to run:**
        ```bash
        python generate_bentogrid_html.py --pdf_file_path "path/to/your/document.pdf"
        ```
    * **Parameters:**
        * `--pdf_file_path`: (Required) The path to your input PDF file. Replace `"path/to/your/document.pdf"` with the actual file path.
    * **Output:**
        The generated HTML file (e.g., `document.html`) will be saved in the `output/` directory within your project.
    * **Viewing:**
        Open the generated HTML file in any web browser to view the dashboard.

2.  **Generate Multi-Slide 16:9 HTML Presentation from PDF (`generate_slides.py`)**
    This script reads an input PDF, breaks it down into 3-5 concise, visually engaging key sections, and generates a modern 16:9 HTML presentation slide for each section. Slides feature highlight boxes, icons, and (if possible) simple charts/diagrams for key metrics.

    * **How to run:**
        ```bash
        python generate_slides.py --pdf_file_path "path/to/your/document.pdf"
        ```
    * **Parameters:**
        * `--pdf_file_path`: (Required) The path to your input PDF file. Replace `"path/to/your/document.pdf"` with the actual file path.
    * **Output:**
        Each slide is saved as a separate HTML file (e.g., `slide_01_Section_Title.html`) in the `output_slides/` directory.
    * **Viewing:**
        Open the generated HTML files in any web browser to view the slides. Each file is a single, visually engaging presentation slide.
 
3.  **Convert HTML Page to JPEG Image (`convert_html_to_jpeg.py`)**
    This script takes an HTML file (typically one generated by the `generate_bentogrid_html.py` script) and converts it into a JPEG image. **This requires Chromium to be installed (see Installation Step 5).**
 
    * **How to run:**
        ```bash
        python convert_html_to_jpeg.py \
            --local_html_path "output/document.html" \
            --output_jpeg_path "output/your_image_name.jpeg"
        ```
    * **Parameters:**
        * `--local_html_path`: (Required) Path to the local HTML file you want to convert (e.g., the output from the previous step).
        * `--output_jpeg_path`: (Required) Desired path and filename for the output JPEG image.
    * **Output:**
        The JPEG image will be saved to the specified `output_jpeg_path`.
